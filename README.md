# ChessGame
This is a normal Chess Game program that allows two players to play against each other.

Current Status:
Currently, the board has been created from scratch out of buttons. The pieces have all their possible moves and can correctly move on 
the board. Pieces can kill each other and all moves are regulated on the board by the pieces capabilities and spots available. 

Next Steps:
This project does not have check or checkmate. In the near future sprints, I plan to add these features as well as complete 
castling, the else el passant move for pawn, create a database for checking moves and redoing moves, and other possible moves and
rules not covered.

Future Steps:
Future Iterations: Add clean menu for saving, adding, and starting new games, Add A.I. to play against, 
and add ability to customize pieces.
